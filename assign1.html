        <p>Six college students-- a rich guy, a rich gay guy, two rich twin people, another rich person that keeps taking their money,
            and a normal person on financial aid-- find themselves taken in by the teachings of the elusive Greek professor, Julian. 
            After one thing leads to another, secret rituals lead to the group getting involved in a murder-- first of an innocent passersby,
            and later, on eof their very own: Bunny.

            The victim and perpetrators are known from the first page. Unlike typical murder stories, <i>The Secret History</i> explore 
            more of the events that led up to the murder, and then the aftermath. Honestly, I just liked the way the words flowed. Chill vibes,
            love the way their sanity started crumbling-- absolutely amazing. I think Henry was pretty cool, and Francis. Richard was alright,
            poor guy was kinda traumatized. Kinda funny.
